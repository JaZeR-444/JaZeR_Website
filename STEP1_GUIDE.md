# Step 1: Create Contentful Account & Space

## Instructions:

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://www.contentful.com

2. **Sign up for a free account:**
   - Click "Sign up" in the top right
   - Choose your preferred sign-up method (email, Google, GitHub)
   - Complete the registration process

3. **Create your first space:**
   - After logging in, you'll be prompted to create a space
   - Name it: `JaZeR Website`
   - Choose "Community tier" (it's free and perfect for getting started)
   - Select "Build from scratch" when asked about templates

4. **Verify your space is created:**
   - You should see your new space dashboard
   - The URL should show something like: `app.contentful.com/spaces/YOUR_SPACE_ID`

## What happens next:

Once you have your Contentful space created, you'll need to:

1. **Get your API credentials** (Space ID and access tokens)
2. **Create the content models** (Music Release, Video, Page, Shop Item)
3. **Set up environment variables** in your project
4. **Run the migration script** to import sample content
